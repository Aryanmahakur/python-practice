The Wise Donkeyâ€™s Tale

Upon a hill so high and steep,
Lived a #, strong and deep.
With ears so long and coat so gray,
He brayed aloud at break of day.

The horses mocked, the cows would stare,
"Just a #! Do you care?"
But he just smiled and walked with grace,
A steady heart, a patient pace.

One fine day, the fields were dry,
The river gone, the sun too high.
The clever # dug so deep,
And found a stream so cool to keep.

The farmer cheered, the town would say,
"Our # saved the crops today!"
No longer mocked, but praised instead,
The # walked with lifted head.

So never judge by looks alone,
For wisdom grows where it is sown.
And even #s, strong yet mild,
Can teach the world with patience wild.
