The Wise Donkeyâ€™s Tale

Upon a hill so high and steep,
Lived a donkey, strong and deep.
With ears so long and coat so gray,
He brayed aloud at break of day.

The horses mocked, the cows would stare,
"Just a donkey! Do you care?"
But he just smiled and walked with grace,
A steady heart, a patient pace.

One fine day, the fields were dry,
The river gone, the sun too high.
The clever donkey dug so deep,
And found a stream so cool to keep.

The farmer cheered, the town would say,
"Our donkey saved the crops today!"
No longer mocked, but praised instead,
The donkey walked with lifted head.

So never judge by looks alone,
For wisdom grows where it is sown.
And even donkeys, strong yet mild,
Can teach the world with patience wild.
